1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   First of all, remote repositories are common references for everybody working on a specific project,
   since they represent the "standard resources pool": they allow to collaborate with other programmers.
   Furthermore, storing a project repository on a remote server is an effective backup, protecting
   from accidental damages to your own computer and allowing to continue working on a project from other
   workstations and/or devices.
